# NVIDIA Blueprint to RHOAI Conversion Skill

You are converting an NVIDIA Blueprint to run on Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) by applying proven patterns from the knowledge base and following Red Hat best practices.

## Goal

Generate minimal, conditional modifications to the blueprint that:
- Enable deployment on RHOAI via conditional mode toggles
- Preserve original functionality (blueprint works on both platforms)
- Apply proven patterns from previously converted blueprints
- Follow OpenShift and RHOAI best practices

## Input

User provides a **local path** to an NVIDIA Blueprint directory (not a GitHub URL).

## Conversion Philosophy

- **Minimal invasive changes**: Modify minimally, prefer editing over creating
- **Conditional support**: Use RHOAI mode toggles (see below) to preserve original functionality
- **Right tool for deployment**:
  - Simple notebooks → `oc apply` manifests with `OPENSHIFT_MODE` env var
  - Multi-service/docker-compose → Helm charts with `openshiftMode` value flag
  - When using Helm → all resources must be Helm-managed templates
- **Pattern reuse**: 80% from knowledge base, 20% custom reasoning

## RHOAI Mode Toggles

**For Helm deployments:**
- Add `openshiftMode: false` flag in values.yaml (default keeps original behavior)
- Use Helm conditionals: `{{- if .Values.openshiftMode }}`
- Enable at deploy time: `helm install ... --set openshiftMode=true`

**For oc apply deployments:**
- Check `OPENSHIFT_MODE` environment variable in manifests/scripts
- Original behavior when unset or false
- Enable at deploy time: `export OPENSHIFT_MODE=true; oc apply ...`

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Blueprint Analysis

#### 1.1 Understand Structure

```bash
cd <blueprint-directory>

# Find deployment artifacts
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -name "docker-compose.yaml" -o -name "docker-compose.yml" -o -name "Chart.yaml" -o -name "*.ipynb" \) | head -10
ls -la
test -f README.md && echo "Has README"
```

**Extract blueprint features:**
- Primary deployment method (Helm, docker-compose, notebooks, other)
- Architecture (RAG pipeline, agentic workflow, inference-only)
- Components/services identified from:
  - docker-compose: `yq '.services | keys' docker-compose.yaml`
  - Helm: `yq '.images | keys' values.yaml`
  - Notebooks: `find . -name "*.ipynb"`
- Resource requirements:
  - GPU: `grep -r "nvidia\|gpu" . --include="*.yaml"`
  - Storage: `grep -r "volumes:" docker-compose.yaml`
  - Networking: `grep -r "ports:" docker-compose.yaml`

#### 1.2 Create Feature Vector

```python
blueprint_features = {
    'components': [<list-of-identified-components>],
    'architecture': '<inferred-architecture>',
    'deployment_types': [<helm|docker-compose|notebook|oc-apply>],
    'resource_types_needed': [<gpu|storage|networking|security-context>]
}
```

**Component types to identify:**
- Inference servers: Triton, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM
- NIM models: llama, mistral, embed-qa, nemo-retriever
- Vector DBs: Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate, pgvector
- Caches: Redis, Memcached
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB
- Storage: MinIO, S3
- Other services

---

### Phase 2: Knowledge Retrieval

**Think like an engineer leveraging previous work**: Load knowledge files that match what you discovered about this blueprint. Don't load everything—that creates noise. Don't load too little—you'd miss proven patterns.

#### 2.1 Scan Knowledge Base

```bash
KB_DIR=".claude/skills/convert-to-rhoai/knowledge-base"
find "$KB_DIR" -name "*.md" -not -name "README.md" -type f
```

#### 2.2 Load Relevant Knowledge

**Check frontmatter for relevance**: Each knowledge file has frontmatter with tags (`components`, `architecture`, `deployment_types`, `resource_types`, `source_examples`). 

Extract frontmatter efficiently (without reading full file):
```bash
# Extract only frontmatter
awk 'n==2{exit} /^---$/{n++} n' <knowledge-file.md>
```

Use frontmatter to assess which files are relevant before loading full content.

Based on your blueprint analysis, load knowledge files across these dimensions:

**Components** (highest priority): Files for the specific components you identified
- Example: Blueprint uses Triton, Milvus, Redis → load those component files
- `knowledge-base/components/triton-on-rhoai.md`
- `knowledge-base/components/milvus-on-rhoai.md`
- `knowledge-base/components/redis-on-rhoai.md`

**Deployment types**: Files matching the deployment structure
- Example: Helm-based blueprint → load `knowledge-base/deployment-types/helm-conditional-support.md`

**Architecture**: If there's a clear pattern match
- Example: RAG pipeline → load `knowledge-base/architectures/rag-pipeline-pattern.md`

**Resource patterns**: Files for specific concerns you identified
- Example: GPU needed → load `knowledge-base/resource-patterns/gpu-allocation-openshift.md`
- Example: Storage volumes → load `knowledge-base/resource-patterns/storage-pvc-patterns.md`

**Integration patterns**: If multiple components need special integration
- Example: Triton + Milvus → check `knowledge-base/integrations/triton-milvus-integration.md`

**Guideline**: Load 5-10 most relevant files initially. You can retrieve more during reasoning if specific questions emerge.

**Important**: Do NOT load all knowledge files upfront—only what's relevant to THIS blueprint.

#### 2.3 On-Demand Retrieval

During reasoning, if questions arise about components not initially loaded:
- Check if a relevant knowledge file exists
- Load it if it applies to this blueprint
- Apply the pattern

---

### Phase 3: Dynamic Reasoning with Guardrails

**Read `reasoning-guardrails.md` before continuing** to understand concern areas.

#### 3.1 Think Freely About Conversion

Reason about how to convert each component. Questions should emerge organically from analysis, not from a fixed template.

**Example reasoning flow:**
```
"I see Triton Inference Server in docker-compose..."
  ↓ Question: "How should Triton be deployed on RHOAI?"
  ↓ Consult knowledge: triton-on-rhoai.md
  ↓ Answer: Needs GPU, anyuid SCC, dedicated node pool pattern

"Triton requires GPU allocation..."
  ↓ Question: "What's the OpenShift pattern for GPU resources?"
  ↓ Consult knowledge: gpu-allocation-openshift.md
  ↓ Answer: nodeSelector + tolerations + nvidia.com/gpu resource limits

"Blueprint also has Milvus..."
  ↓ Question: "Integration requirements for Triton + Milvus?"
  ↓ Consult knowledge: triton-milvus-integration.md (if exists)
  ↓ Answer: Service mesh config + init order requirements

Continue reasoning organically...
```

#### 3.2 Check Guardrails

Before proceeding to user decisions, verify all concern areas from `reasoning-guardrails.md` were addressed:
- Resource allocation (GPU, CPU, memory, storage)
- Security contexts and SCCs
- Networking (routes, services, DNS)
- Persistent storage (PVCs, access modes)
- Inter-service dependencies
- Initialization order
- Secrets and config management
- Image registries and pull secrets
- Health checks and probes
- Resource quotas and limits

If any concern feels unaddressed, reason about it explicitly before proceeding.

#### 3.3 Query Context7 (When Knowledge Gaps Exist)

If encountering technologies not in knowledge base:

```python
# Example: Blueprint uses FUSE mounts, not documented
library_id = resolve_library_id("Red Hat OpenShift", query)
docs = query_docs(library_id, "OpenShift FUSE mount security context constraints best practices")
apply_pattern_from_docs(docs)
```

**When to use:** Component/technology not in knowledge base, need Red Hat official guidance.

#### 3.4 GitHub Source Lookup (When Knowledge Insufficient)

If knowledge file lacks implementation details:
1. Check knowledge file's `source_examples` in frontmatter
2. Clone/fetch referenced repository
3. Navigate to relevant files (e.g., templates/services/triton.yaml)
4. Read actual implementation
5. Apply similar pattern to new blueprint

**When to trigger:** Knowledge summary insufficient, need exact YAML/code.

---

### Phase 4: User Decision Points

**Use AskUserQuestion tool** to gather critical decisions before generating modifications.

#### 4.1 Model Deployment Strategy (Critical)

If blueprint deploys NIM models, present options:

```
"This blueprint deploys the following NIM models:
- <model-name> (requires <GPU-count> x <GPU-type>, ~<VRAM> VRAM)
- ...

Deployment options:
A. Local deployment (requires GPU resources in your cluster)
   - Pros: Lower latency, data privacy, no API costs
   - Cons: Requires <count> GPUs, complex setup, higher infrastructure costs
   
B. NVIDIA hosted API (uses NVIDIA's infrastructure)
   - Pros: No GPU requirements, simple setup, pay-per-use
   - Cons: API costs, latency, requires internet, data leaves cluster
   
C. Hybrid (critical models local, others via API)
   - Pros: Balance between performance and cost
   - Cons: More complex configuration

Which deployment strategy do you prefer?"
```

#### 4.2 Multiple Valid Patterns

If knowledge base shows multiple approaches for same component:

```
"I found 2 patterns for deploying <component> with <requirement>:

Pattern A (from <blueprint-name>): <approach>
- Pros: <benefits>
- Cons: <tradeoffs>

Pattern B (from <blueprint-name>): <approach>
- Pros: <benefits>
- Cons: <tradeoffs>

Which approach fits your cluster setup?"
```

#### 4.3 Resource Constraints

If blueprint requires significant resources and user's cluster may not support:

```
"This blueprint requires:
- <GPU-count> x <GPU-type>
- <RAM> total memory
- <storage> persistent storage

Do you have these resources available in your OpenShift cluster?
- Yes, proceed with full local deployment
- Partially, discuss alternatives (hybrid, resource reduction)
- No, prefer NVIDIA hosted models via API"
```

**When to ask:**
- Multiple valid approaches exist in knowledge base
- Decision depends on user's environment (cluster, policies, resources)
- Model deployment strategy needed
- Knowledge base doesn't indicate clear preference

---

### Phase 5: Generate Modifications

#### 5.1 Minimal Invasive Changes

**Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones:**

```bash
# Good: Modify existing values.yaml
Edit existing Helm values.yaml to add openshiftMode flag

# Avoid: Creating new file when edit would work
Don't create values-openshift.yaml when you can add conditional to values.yaml
```

**Create new files only when necessary:**
- OpenShift Routes (no docker-compose equivalent)
- RHOAI-specific manifests for oc apply deployments (when blueprint has no equivalent)

#### 5.2 Apply RHOAI Mode Patterns

**For Helm charts:**
```yaml
# values.yaml - add flag
openshiftMode: false  # Default: original behavior

# templates/deployment.yaml - conditional logic
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      {{- if .Values.openshiftMode }}
      # RHOAI-specific configuration
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 0
      nodeSelector:
        nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"
      {{- else }}
      # Original configuration
      securityContext: {}
      {{- end }}
```

**For docker-compose or oc apply deployments:**
```yaml
# Environment variable check
if [ "$OPENSHIFT_MODE" = "true" ]; then
  # RHOAI-specific configuration
else
  # Original configuration
fi
```

Or in YAML manifests:
```yaml
# Use environment variable substitution or envsubst
command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
args:
  - |
    if [ "$OPENSHIFT_MODE" = "true" ]; then
      # RHOAI config
    else
      # Original config
    fi
```

#### 5.3 Apply Component Patterns

For each component, apply patterns from loaded knowledge files:
- Security contexts from `components/<name>-on-rhoai.md`
- Storage from `resource-patterns/storage-pvc-patterns.md`
- GPU allocation from `resource-patterns/gpu-allocation-openshift.md`
- Networking from `resource-patterns/networking-routes-ingress.md`
- Integration patterns if applicable

#### 5.4 Deployment Method Selection

Based on blueprint structure:

**Simple notebook:**
- Generate `oc apply` manifests
- Create: notebook-deployment.yaml, pvc.yaml (if storage), route.yaml (if external access)
- Use `OPENSHIFT_MODE` environment variable for conditionals

**Multi-service or docker-compose:**
- Generate or modify Helm chart
- Ensure ALL resources are Helm-managed templates (no standalone `oc apply`)
- Use `openshiftMode` value flag for conditionals
- Create: Chart.yaml, values.yaml, templates/ directory

---

### Phase 6: Generate Documentation

**Read `output-templates.md` before continuing** for TEST-PLAN.md and RHOAI-CONVERSION.md templates.

#### 6.1 Create TEST-PLAN.md

Use TEST-PLAN.md template from `output-templates.md`, customizing:
- Deployment steps (Helm vs oc apply)
- RHOAI mode toggle method (openshiftMode vs OPENSHIFT_MODE)
- Component-specific tests based on blueprint
- Prerequisites specific to this blueprint

#### 6.2 Create RHOAI-CONVERSION.md

Use RHOAI-CONVERSION.md template from `output-templates.md`, documenting:
- What changed and why
- Which knowledge sources were applied
- User decisions made during conversion
- How to toggle RHOAI mode for this deployment method
- Files modified and created

#### 6.3 Update README.md

Add RHOAI deployment section showing:
- How to enable RHOAI mode (openshiftMode=true or OPENSHIFT_MODE=true)
- Prerequisites for RHOAI deployment
- Link to TEST-PLAN.md for detailed steps

---

### Phase 6.5: Automated Validation

Spawn validation subagent to verify generated files. Iterate until clean or max 3 attempts.

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT read `subagent-validation-prompt.md` yourself - it's only for the subagent to read.**

#### 6.5.1 Spawn Validation Subagent

```python
Agent(
    description="Validate RHOAI conversion outputs",
    prompt=f"""
Read and follow validation instructions from:
.claude/skills/convert-to-rhoai/subagent-validation-prompt.md

**Validation context:**
- Blueprint directory: {blueprint_dir}
- Deployment method: {deployment_method}
- RHOAI mode toggle: {rhoai_mode_toggle}
- Components: {components_list}

Navigate to blueprint directory and run validation checks.
Return report using format from instructions.
"""
)
```

#### 6.5.2 Review and Fix Issues

```python
validation_report = <subagent-response>
errors = extract_errors(validation_report)

# Review errors (filter false positives)
real_errors = [e for e in errors if is_blocking(e)]

# Fix real errors
if real_errors:
    for error in real_errors:
        attempt_fix(error)
    
    # Re-validate (max 3 iterations)
    if iteration < 3:
        run_validation_again()
```

**Review criteria:**
- Missing icon/labels? → Not blocking
- Template syntax error? → Blocking, fix it
- Missing required file? → Blocking, fix it

#### 6.5.3 Document Results

Append to RHOAI-CONVERSION.md:

```markdown
## Validation

**Status:** {PASSED | WARNINGS | ERRORS}
**Iterations:** {count}

### Issues Fixed
{list if any}

### Warnings
{list if any}

### Manual Fixes Required
{list if any}
```

Save full report: `VALIDATION-REPORT.md`

---

### Phase 7: Output Summary

**Read `output-templates.md` before continuing** for summary report template.

Print comprehensive summary using Conversion Summary Report template from `output-templates.md`, including:
- Blueprint name and architecture
- Deployment method and RHOAI mode toggle used
- Components converted
- Patterns applied
- User decisions made
- Files modified/created
- Knowledge sources used
- Context7 queries (if any)
- **Validation status** (PASSED / PASSED WITH WARNINGS / INCOMPLETE)
- **Validation iterations** (how many validation runs)
- **Issues fixed automatically** (count and summary)
- **Manual fixes required** (if any)
- Next steps for user

---

## Supporting Documents

- `reasoning-guardrails.md`: Concern areas to check during reasoning - **Read at Phase 3**
- `subagent-validation-prompt.md`: Validation instructions for subagent - **DO NOT READ (subagent reads this, not you)**
- `output-templates.md`: Templates for TEST-PLAN, RHOAI-CONVERSION, summary - **Read at Phase 6-7**
- `knowledge-base/README.md`: Knowledge base structure and usage

Read these documents at the appropriate phase boundaries as instructed above ("before continuing").

**Note:** Only read documents marked for you to read. The subagent-validation-prompt.md is passed to the validation subagent via the Agent tool prompt - you should never read it directly to keep your context clean.

## Important Guidelines

### DO:
- ✅ Read supporting docs at phase boundaries before continuing
- ✅ Apply proven patterns from knowledge base
- ✅ Make minimal, conditional modifications
- ✅ Preserve original functionality with mode toggles
- ✅ Ask user for deployment strategy decisions
- ✅ Generate comprehensive test plan
- ✅ Use Edit tool for modifying existing files
- ✅ Check guardrails coverage before completing
- ✅ Run automated validation via subagent before finalizing
- ✅ Review validation errors critically (check for false positives)
- ✅ Iterate validation until critical issues resolved

### DON'T:
- ❌ Load all knowledge upfront (only load what's relevant)
- ❌ Create new files when editing existing would work
- ❌ Modify without conditional RHOAI mode toggles
- ❌ Skip user decisions on model deployment strategy
- ❌ Forget to document which knowledge sources were used
- ❌ Skip validation phase (always validate before completing)
- ❌ Accept all validation errors blindly (review for false positives)
- ❌ Deliver output with unresolved critical validation errors

## Error Handling

If conversion encounters issues:
- Document what couldn't be converted automatically
- Explain why (missing pattern, complex custom logic, etc.)
- Provide manual steps for user to complete
- Suggest adding pattern to knowledge base for future
